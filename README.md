# Visualize Data with a Bar Chart

This is the [sixth project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart) for freeCodeCamp's Data Visualization certificate.

Completed On: 09 August 2017  

## Objective

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/vGjLVZ.

## User Stories

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- I can see US Gross Domestic Product by quarter, over time.
- I can mouse over a bar and see a tooltip with the GDP amount and exact year and month that bar represents.

**Hint**: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json
